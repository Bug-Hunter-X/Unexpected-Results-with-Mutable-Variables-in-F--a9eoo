let mutable x = 10
let mutable y = 20
let add x y = x + y
printf "%d" (add x y)
//The problem is that F# is immutable by default, and using mutable variables can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled carefully.  The function `add` doesn't modify the values of x and y; instead, it computes their sum. If you intended to change x and y within the function, that won't happen.
